Command line Minesweeper game written in C

Background Information:
  This program was oddly enough originally written for my Art 100 class in college. Clearly this program has little to do with art (in regards to the common definition of art), but my professor seemed very receptive to the idea.(A nice side effect was I had a chance to make somthing in C) I printed it off with syntax highlighting and handed it in, in paper form. It didn't matter that he couldn't read it or that it was incomplete. I have talked to him since then and he still has the original paper copy within arm's reach of his desk.


Note: This game is not yet complete or even playable yet.
